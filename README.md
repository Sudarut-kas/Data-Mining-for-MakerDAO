# Data-Mining-for-MakerDAO

This research project is to construct a complete dataset, infuse it with relevant financial characteristics, and develop a mathematical model designed to estimate the likelihood of default for loans within the MakerDAO ecosystem. This multimodal method seeks to provide useful insights into the risk assessment and lending dynamics of decentralized finance platforms on MakerDAO.

**Create a Comprehensive Dataset:** The first sub-goal is to create a robust dataset encompassing loan portfolios originating from MakerDAO. This dataset will act as the primary source of information for the succeeding phases of the project. It will feature a diversified range of loan portfolios with varying financial characteristics, lending histories, and borrower profiles.

**Enhance Dataset with Financial features:** The second sub-goal entails enhancing the dataset with essential financial features related to borrowing. Loan amounts, interest rates, collateral kinds, and borrower profiles are examples of these features. This enrichment is critical for a thorough examination of borrowing habits inside the MakerDAO ecosystem.

**Create and Improve a Specialized Probability of Default Model:** The third sub-objective focuses on the development and improvement of a specialized mathematical model. The goal of this model is to assess and predict the likelihood of default in the context of MakerDAO's financing activity. The model will combine several parameters based on the enriched dataset to assess the chance of borrowers defaulting on their obligations.
